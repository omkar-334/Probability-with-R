# Collecting, Analyzing and Visualizing Data  
   
#### Variables -   
	-Numerical(quantitative)  
			-Continuous - range  
			-Discrete - specific set  
	-Categorical(qualitative)  
			-Regular - Yes/No or dont have levels  
			-Ordinal - have ordered levels  
  
#### Relationships between Variables  
	-Associated(dependent) - show some connection  
			-Positive  
			-Negative  
	-Independent - no connection  
  
#### Studies   
	-Observational - Doesnt interfere with data(only establishes association)  
			-Retrospective - Past data  
			-Prospective - Current data  
	-Experimental - Random assignment , Establish Causation between explanatory and response veriables  
  
#### Confounding variables  
Extraneous variables that affect both explanatory and response variable and make it seem like there is a relationship between them  
Correlation=/Causation  
	  
#### Census  
sample of entire population  
  
#### Sources of sampling bias  
	-Convenience Sample - Easy accessible people are more likely to be included  
	-Non-Response Sample - (initial random sample) A fraction of people do not respond to the survey  
	-Voluntary Response - (Not random sample) Sample consists of volunteers, they may have strong opinions  
  
#### Sampling Methods   
	-Simple Random Sample(SRS) - Randomly selecting cases from population, such that each case is equally likely to be selected  
	-Cluster Sample - Divide population into homogeneous strata and then randomly sample within each strata  
	-Stratified Sample - Divide population into clusters, randomly sample few clusters and then sample all people within those clusters  
	-Multistage Sample - Divide population into clusters, randomly sample few clusters and then sample people randomly within those clusters

#### Types of Variables  
	Blocking Variables - a nuisance variable they want to control for, hence they block for it.  
	Explanatory Variables - variables might be affecting the outcome.

	Random Sampling - occurs when subjects are being selected for a study - Generalizability of results  
	Random Assignment - occurs only in experimental settings  
	Sampling occurs first -> Then Assignment occurs  
	Exploratory Analysis -> Representative Sample -> Inference
